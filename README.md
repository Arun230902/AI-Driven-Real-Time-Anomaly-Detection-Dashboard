# 🚀 AI-Assisted AIOps: Throughput Anomaly Detection System

A production-ready AIOps system that uses **Prometheus, Grafana, Python, and Docker** to collect metrics, forecast throughput anomalies, and provide real-time insights into system performance.

This project combines **metrics monitoring + ML anomaly detection** to help predict performance issues before they impact production.
